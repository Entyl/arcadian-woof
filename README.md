# Secure File Sharing
This project was for my Applied Cryptography class.  
Two other students and I worked on it together.  
The point of the project was to protect from given threats, and at the end think of our own threats and protect against them.  
A simple example is that we would use RSA signatures so that a user could not modify or forge their Token(data structure that holds user information and rights).  
The three write ups under "docs" on GitHub have a much more in-depth analysis and explanation on what we implemented and why.  
The instructions on how to run and compile the project are also under "docs".
